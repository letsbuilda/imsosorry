History
=======

Gitautas wanted a easy first Python project, so he made `slowo https://github.com/gitautas/slowo`_.
I helped him with a bit of syntax and setting up the packaging boilerplate.

He then raised an `issue https://github.com/python-discord/sir-lancebot/issues/812`_ and a `PR https://github.com/python-discord/sir-lancebot/pull/879`_ to replace the Sir Lancebot implemention with his new more featureful library.
I helped him finalize some of the nitpicks and cleanup from the reviews. We copied and pasted the code into Lancebot's code base to avoid adding another dependency.

His code now lives in Sir Lancebot.
But I wanted the code for my own bots, and it really is a kinda fun project to play with, so I made my own library here in this repo, and implemented it in my bots.

In the future.... What comes next? An OwO command? Even more advanced UwUifications? Who knows?
